# Data Reporting: Claims Frequency Modelling Using Poisson GLM, Trees, and Boosting

ACST4005 Case Study (2025)

This case study focused on data reporting and modelling of Poisson claims frequency using GLM, regression trees, and boosting. Emphasized reproducible code, model comparison, and clear visualization.

## Key Tasks
- Performed EDA and fitted Poisson GLM  
- Applied regression trees and boosting  
- Reported model performance and comparisons  

## Skills Demonstrated
- R Markdown for reproducible claims reporting  
- Model fitting and visualization  
- Data-driven model comparison  

## Submission Details
- Original R Markdown source (428809037ChaeYunbaeCaseStudy.Rmd) included for reproducibility  
- Rendered outputs: PDF and HTML versions of the report  
- Grade: 10.50/25.00 (submitted early, feedback on missing summary statistics and best model selection)
